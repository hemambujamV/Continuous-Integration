# Continuous Integration
CI is one of the most popular application development practices in recent times. Developers integrate bug fix, new feature development, or innovative functionality in code repository. The CI tool verifies the integration process with an automated build and automated test execution to detect issues with the current source of an application, and provide quick feedback.
Jenkins is a simple, extensible, and user-friendly open source tool that provides CI services for application development. Jenkins supports SCM tools such as StarTeam, Subversion, CVS, Git, AccuRev and so on. Jenkins can build Freestyle, Apache Ant, and Apache Maven-based projects.

Installation and Configuration of Code Repository and Build Tools.

Dashboard View Plugin:
This plugin presents a new view that provides a portal-like view for Jenkins build jobs. Download it from https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dashboard+View. 

This project is on how to set up an environment to use Jenkins for continuous integration, and we have also configured build tools in Jenkins. The integration of Eclipse with SVN will help developers to easily perform operations on repositories.
